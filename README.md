Also attached is the simple bash script (DOIT) that I use to invoke it so that it feeds a data file (I) and a prompt
(P0) to the LLM web interface through the python harness. Why the bash script? Just so that I (an old fashioned shell
guy) can more easily control the Python code by messing around with the arguments.
