Honestly, communication is a huge problem here. No one is ever on the same page.
Management doesn't listen to us. We bring up issues, and nothing changes.
There's way too much work and not enough people to do it.
The pay is not great, and it's hard to stay motivated.
Favoritism. Certain people get treated better or get more opportunities.
Lack of training. I felt super unprepared when I started.
People gossip a lot, and it creates a toxic environment.
The expectations are unclear. I'm often not sure what's expected of me.
We're understaffed, so everyone is constantly stressed.
I feel like I'm not appreciated for the work I do.
Micromanagement. I feel like I'm not trusted to do my job.
There's no room for growth. I don't see a future for myself here.
Poor work-life balance. I'm always taking work home with me.
Lack of transparency from leadership. We're kept in the dark about a lot.
Outdated systems and technology slow everything down.
There's no flexibility. We're treated like robots.
People are burned out, and it feels like no one cares.
The office culture is cliquey. If you're not 'in,' you're left out.
Decisions are made without consulting the people they affect.
Upper management is out of touch with what's actually happening.
We don't get enough feedback, so it's hard to know how we're doing.
Turnover is really high, and it's making everything harder.
Too many last-minute changes and unrealistic deadlines.
I feel like there's no support from my manager.
The workload keeps increasing, but we're not getting more help.
People aren't held accountable, so others end up picking up the slack.
There's no sense of teamwork. Everyone just looks out for themselves.
Compensation is not fair compared to the work we're doing.
There's a lot of red tape, and it takes forever to get anything done.
People are promoted based on who they know, not their performance.
I don't feel safe bringing up concerns. There's fear of retaliation.
The benefits package is pretty weak compared to other companies.
Workloads are uneven. Some people are overwhelmed, while others coast.
Managers play favorites. It's obvious, and it's demoralizing.
There's no clear career path. I don't know how to advance.
Decisions are made arbitrarily. There's no consistency.
The atmosphere is tense. People are on edge all the time.
There's a lot of miscommunication. Things constantly get mixed up.
We're always expected to work overtime without extra pay.
The company doesn't invest in employees' development.
People don't respect each other's time. Meetings are constant and unproductive.
The performance evaluation process is unfair and confusing.
Morale is low. People are just here to collect a paycheck.
There's no recognition when we do well, but plenty of criticism when we mess up.
The policies keep changing, and it's hard to keep up.
It feels like there's no leadership. We're just drifting.
Everything feels rushed. There's no time to do quality work.
Communication from the top is vague. We're left guessing.
I feel like my voice doesn't matter. Suggestions are ignored.
Stress levels are through the roof. It's not a healthy environment.
